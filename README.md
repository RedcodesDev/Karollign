###### About Robot Karol
*Robot Karol is a programming environment with a programming language intended for schoolchildren to learn programming and to introduce algorithms. Robot Karol follows the tradition of ‚Äúmini-languages‚Äù. These are programming languages that deliberately have a small, clear range of languages to make it easier to get started with algorithms.*
